## Why RoadRate?
**Have you ever been perplexed by a neighbor that continuously parks in a way that blocks you from using an otherwise perfectly viable space?**

With RoadRate, you can find their license plate, rate it, and leave an anonymous review.

**What about that time you relied on the help of a stranger for a jump?**

You can use RoadRate to publically acknowledge how impactful the kindness of strangers can be.
